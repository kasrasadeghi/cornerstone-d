the eventual way the system will work is an intermingling of programs

there will be some initial grammar and a language snippet of that initial
grammar.
a single pass will transform a language snippet of the initial grammar to some
other grammar.

we will either create the output grammar by creating the full grammar ourselves,
or describing it is a patch to a previous grammar.

=> grammar patching program

we'll need to the run the verifier with the grammar and the output of the pass
that we ran.
